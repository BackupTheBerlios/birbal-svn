Directory structure:

Under apps, a series of apps

idea being that since production and development are going side by side,
there will be constant tinkering with the db - if split up, sqlreset can be
freely used without disturbing more mature apps like the main website which
is complete. Have to be careful to import stuff across apps, but that is
do-able 

website - specfic to website, documentation, advertisements faqs etc

payroll - people management

accounts - basically a reworked subset of avsap

register - the main births and deaths module

address - town and street mapping
